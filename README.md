### Bayesian Fine-Mapping and Association for Population and Pedigree Data


BFMAP is a software tool for genomic analysis of quantitative traits, with a focus on fine-mapping, SNP-set association, and functional enrichment. It uses phenotypes and genotypes, and works for samples with population structure and/or relatedness. BFMAP currently supports the following analyses.

- Estimating SNP-heritability;
- Genome-wide single-marker/SNP-set association analysis;
- Fine-mapping by forward selection or shotgun stochastic search;
- Estimating causal-variant enrichment of a functional annotation (i.e., functional enrichment analysis);
- Incorporating functional enrichment into fine-mapping.
